## System Requirements

### Operating System

- Linux (Ubuntu 20, 22, 24)
- MacOS 12.0+

### Hardware

- Sufficient memory to run vision and other models
- Reliable WiFi or other networking
- Sensors such as cameras, microphones, LIDAR units, IMUs
- Actuators and outputs such as speakers, visual displays, and movement platforms (legs, arms, hands)
- Hardware connected to the "central" computer via `Zenoh`, `CycloneDDS`, serial, usb, or custom APIs/libraries

### Software

Ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- `Python` >= 3.10
- `uv` >= 0.6.2 as the Python package manager and virtual environment
- `portaudio` for audio input and output
- `ffmpeg` for video processing
- [Openmind API key](https://portal.openmind.org/)

#### UV (A Rust and Python package manager)

``` bash
# Mac
brew install uv 

# Linux
curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh 
```

#### PortAudio Library

For audio functionlity, install `portaudio`:

```bash
# Mac
brew install portaudio

# Linux
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install portaudio19-dev python-all-dev
```

#### ffmpeg

For video functionlity, install FFmpeg:

```bash Mac
# Mac
brew install ffmpeg

# Linux
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install ffmpeg
``` 

## Installation and Setup

1. Clone the repository

Run the following commands to clone the repository and set up the environment:

```bash clone repo
git clone https://github.com/openmind/OM1.git
cd OM1
git submodule update --init
uv venv
```

2. Set the configuration variables

Locate the `config` folder and add your OpenMind API key to `/config/spot.json` (for example). If you do not already have one, you can obtain a free access key at https://portal.openmind.org/.  

```bash
# /config/spot.json
...
"api_key": "om1_live_..."
...
```

Note: Using the placeholder key **openmind-free** will generate errors.

Or, create a `.env` file in the project directory and add the following:

```bash
OM_API_KEY=om1_live_...
```

3. Run the Spot Agent

Run the following command to start the Spot Agent:

```bash
uv run src/run.py spot
```

Some necessary packages will be installed during this process, the first time you run the command. This might take a little time. Please be patient. Then you will see the system come to life.

### WebSim to check input and output

Go to [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000) to see real time logs along with the input and output in the terminal. For easy debugging, add `--debug` to see additional logging information.

### Understanding the Log Data

The log data provide insight into how the `spot` agent makes sense of its enviroment and decides on its next actions.

  - First, it detects a person using vision.
  - Communicates with an external AI API for response generation.
  - The LLM(s) decide on a set of actions (dancing and speaking).
  - The simulated robot expresses emotions via a front-facing display.
  - Logs latency and processing times to monitor system performance.
  
```bash
Object Detector INPUT
// START
You see a person in front of you. You also see a laptop.
// END

AVAILABLE ACTIONS:
command: move
    A movement to be performed by the agent.
    Effect: Allows the agent to move.
    Arguments: Allowed values: 'stand still', 'sit', 'dance', 'shake paw', 'walk', 'walk back', 'run', 'jump', 'wag tail'

command: speak
    Words to be spoken by the agent.
    Effect: Allows the agent to speak.
    Arguments: <class 'str'>

command: emotion
    A facial expression to be performed by the agent.
    Effect: Performs a given facial expression.
    Arguments: Allowed values: 'cry', 'smile', 'frown', 'think', 'joy'

What will you do? Command: 

INFO:httpx:HTTP Request: POST https://api.openmind.org/api/core/openai/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
INFO:root:OpenAI LLM output: commands=[Command(type='move', value='wag tail'), Command(type='speak', value="Hi there! I see you and I'm excited!"), Command(type='emotion', value='joy')]
```

## More Examples

There are more pre-configured agents in the `/config` folder. They can be run with the following command:

```bash
uv run src/run.py <agent_name>
```

For example, to run the `conversation` agent:

```bash
uv run src/run.py conversation
```
