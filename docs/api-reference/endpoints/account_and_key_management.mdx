Your OpenMind account and API keys are used for authentication and authorization in your applications. You can manage your account and keys via the [web portal (portal.openmind.org)](https://portal.openmind.org) or directly via an API. The API provides access to the full set of operations (generate, delete, account balance, and key listing):

```bash
https://api.openmind.org/api/core

post $core/api_keys/create
post $core/api_keys/delete
get $core/account/balance  # get your account balance
get $core/api_keys         # list API keys 
```

Note: A JWT token is generated with [Clerk](https://clerk.com/) and is used to authenticate your requests. Ensure you have the necessary permissions to access this endpoint.
