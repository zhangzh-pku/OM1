## Hardware needs

The autonomous exploration capability requires a laserscan sensor to be mounted to the head of the Go2. We recommend the [RPLidar A1M8](https://bucket-download.slamtec.com/d1e428e7efbdcd65a8ea111061794fb8d4ccd3a0/LD108_SLAMTEC_rplidar_datasheet_A1M8_v3.0_en.pdf). Please see the [RPLidar setup documentation](motion_planning_lidarA1M8) for more information.

## Overview

Using OM1, the Unitree Go2 is able to autonomously explore spaces such as your home. There are several parts to this capability. To get started, launch OM1:

```bash Run OM1
uv run src/run.py unitree_go2_lidar
```

### RPLIDAR Laserscan Data

OM1 uses the RPLIDAR to tell the core LLMs about nearby objects. This information flows as natural language to the core LLMs from `/input/plugins/rplidar.py`. The LIDAR data are also used in the action driver to check for viable paths before and during motions are executed. 

### Core LLM Directed Motion

Depending on the sensed spatial environment, the core LLMs can generate contextually appropriate motion commands. 

```py
# actions/move_safe_lidar/interface.py
  TURN_LEFT = "turn left"
  TURN_RIGHT = "turn right"
  MOVE_FORWARDS = "move forwards"
  STAND_STILL = "stand still"
```
These commands are defined in `actions/move_safe_lidar/interface.py` and are converted to motions in `/actions/move_safe_lidar/connector/ros2.py`.

## Data Priorities

### Normal case

* The LIDAR does not sense anything in proximity (within 1.1m or closer).

In this case, the Go2 moves about the room controlled by the core LLMs. 

### Object nearby possible moves are constrained

The LIDAR senses something within 1.1 m (or less) and uses that information to tell the core LLMs about which paths are possible. For example, the LIDAR may tell the core LLMS that:

```
Here is information about objects and walls around you. Use this information to plan your movements and avoid bumping into things: The safe movement choices are: You can turn left. You can turn right. 
```

If all directions are blocked, the LIDAR tells the LLMs that:

```
You are surrounded by objects and cannot safely move in any direction. DO NOT MOVE.
```

In this case, the core LLMs **should** command the Go2 to avoid the object(s).
